# Diff from the original code
 - No dependency to JSONSP 
 - Instead, use json-stream: new-line separated json parsing

# JSONRPC-TCP

[JSON-RPC](http://json-rpc.org/) over TCP/IP for [Node](http://nodejs.org).

## Installation

    $ npm install jsonrpc-tcp

Install from source code repository:

    $ git clone git@github.com:jaredhanson/node-jsonrpc-tcp.git
    $ cd node-jsonrpc-tcp
    $ npm install

Through [JSONSP](https://github.com/jaredhanson/node-jsonsp), JSONRPC-TCP
depends on [YAJL](http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/) and the
[YAJL binding for Node.js](https://github.com/vibornoff/node-yajl).  libyajl
must be installed on your system prior to installing JSONRPC-TCP.

Install YAJL via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) on Mac OS X:

    $ brew install yajl
